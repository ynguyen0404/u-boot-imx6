U-Boot for Variscite DART-6UL / VAR-SOM-6UL boards
--------------------------------------------------

This single U-Boot supports 2 different SOM/carrier board combinations:
DART-6UL on VAR-6ULCustomBoard and VAR-SOM-6UL on Concerto-Board.

Each SOM type can come in various configurations (can be with
i.MX6 UL/ULL/ULZ SOCs with different configurations and CPU frequencies,
can be with different types and capacities of eMMC/NAND flash, RAM, etc.)

Building U-Boot
---------------

$ make mrproper

Choose one of the following:
$ make mx6ul_var_dart_mmc_defconfig		    # For booting from SD card/eMMC
$ make mx6ul_var_dart_nand_defconfig		    # For booting from NAND flash
$ make mx6ul_var_dart_mmc_SECURE_BOOT_defconfig     # For booting from SD card/eMMC with secure boot support
$ make mx6ul_var_dart_nand_SECURE_BOOT_defconfig    # For booting from NAND flash with secure boot support

$ make


Flashing U-Boot to an SD card
-----------------------------

- After the 'make' command completes, flash the generated SPL & U-Boot
binaries into the SD card:

$ sudo dd if=SPL of=/dev/sdX bs=1K seek=1; sync
$ sudo dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1K seek=69; sync

(replace /dev/sdX with your correct device node)

- Insert the micro SD card into the slot on the board.

- Connect the debug cable to the host PC.

- Make sure the boot select is set to SD / EXT.

- Power up the board and U-Boot messages will appear in the serial console.
